        <h3>How to Prepare </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium sized saucepan, add the vegetable oil and heat it on medium</li>
            <li>Once the oil has heated up, add the onion and tomato</li>
            <li>Stir occasionally until the onions have gone soft</li>
            <li>Add the groundnut sauce to the mixture, followed by the water</li>
            <li>Cook the mixture until it has been brought to a boil, making sure to keep stirring to allow it to properly mix</li>
            <li>Once it has been brought to a boil, reduce the heat to low and allow it to simmer for around 25-30 minutes. Make sure to stir regularly to prevent lumps and avoid the sauce from sticking to the bottom</li>
            <li>Add salt to taste</li>
            <li>If the sauce is too thick for your liking, add more boiling water until it reaches desired consistency. If it needs to be thickened more, let it boil for a couple more minutes.</li>
            <li>Once the sauce has been cooked, you will find that the groundnut oil will have separated and risen to the top. This is a indication that the sauce has cooked for long enough (undercooking the raw groundnuts can cause an upset stomach if eaten!)</li>
            <li>Serve Binyebwa sauce as desired; there are a number of ways it can be served:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Alongside mashed matoke (boiled plantain)</li>
                <li>Alongside dried fish</li>
                <li>Mixed in dodo (dried pumpkin leaves)</li>
                <li>Mixed in with cassava leaves or spinach</li>
                <li>Rice</li>
                <li>Posho/Ugali (maize flour cooked in boiling water)</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
